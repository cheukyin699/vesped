# VESPED - (VEry Small Program EDitor)

This is my VEry Small Program EDitor (VESPED). You input commands on a command
line interpreter, similar to GW-BASIC, which is where I got the inspiration
from.


# Usage

```sh
./vesped <filename>
```

## Basic commands

```sh
list		# Lists all lines from buffer
save		# Saves file
quit		# Quits current program
```
